# YOLO-World
Zero-Shot Object Detection with YOLO-World. YOLO-World was designed to solve a limitation of existing zero-shot object detection models: speed. Whereas other state-of-the-art models use Transformers, a powerful but typically slower architecture, YOLO-World uses the faster CNN-based YOLO architecture.
